Logic:

Start screen:
A window where you input how many vowels you would like
This is what starts the game - the player who first enters how many words they would like is the Player 1
This calls get_letters_chosen and its result is displayed to the users

A timer then starts, counting down from 30 seconds
In this time, each player can submit one answer - if it is right or wrong, both have to wait until the end of the thirty seconds

At the end of the time:
Both answers are validated
    If an answer is invalid, an invalid flag is set
        If only one answer is invalid, then the other player automatically gets points from their word
        If both answers are invalid, the round is a draw and both score zero
    If an answer is valid (i.e. is present in words.txt and matches the chosen letters)
        The player gets the points from their word (not applied to score)
        These points are compared and the winning score is appended to the player

new round process:
times up and score of player
tell server new round

Repeat six times

Compare both scores at the end, winner is the player with the most

i don't think that we should make you wait all the thirty seconds
for 1P: the round should end after either submitting a guess or the time being up
